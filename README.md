Feedback 

Overview
Welcome to the Feedback System, a Next.js and TypeScript application designed to facilitate seamless feedback collection from users. This system allows individuals to provide feedback to designated users through a unique URL. Additionally, the system is integrated with AI to suggest messages, making the feedback process easier and more efficient.

Features
User-Specific URLs: Each user in the system is assigned a unique URL. This URL can be shared with anyone to collect feedback.
AI-Powered Suggestions: Integrated AI provides message suggestions to help the feedback giver formulate their thoughts.
Real-Time Feedback Submission: The system ensures that feedback is promptly sent to the intended user, allowing for immediate insights.
Next.js and TypeScript: Built with modern web technologies for performance and type safety.

How It Works
User URL Generation: Each user receives a unique URL that can be shared with others.
Feedback Form: Upon accessing the URL, a feedback form is displayed where individuals can write their feedback.
AI Suggestions: The AI integration suggests possible feedback messages, which can be used directly or customized.
Feedback Submission: Once the feedback is written, it can be submitted and is immediately sent to the designated user.
